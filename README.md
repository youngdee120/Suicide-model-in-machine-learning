Deployment Methods
In this project, I have implemented two different methods to deploy the machine learning model for text prediction. Both methods allow users to input text and receive predictions on whether the text is suicidal or non-suicidal, along with a reason for the prediction. Below are the details of both deployment approaches:

1. Streamlit Deployment (app.py)
   Streamlit is a Python library that enables rapid deployment of machine learning models in the form of interactive web applications. I used Streamlit to build a simple, user-friendly interface for the model. Here’s how it works:

   Model and Data Loading: The model, vocabulary, and reasons for prediction (suicidal and non-suicidal) are loaded into the application using pickle to deserialize the pre-trained model and open() to read the vocabulary and reasons from text files.

   User Input: Users can input their text into a provided text area.

   Text Preprocessing: The input text is preprocessed (lowercased, punctuation and numbers removed, links removed) to ensure that the model receives clean data.

   Prediction: The preprocessed text is vectorized using the vocabulary (turning it into a numerical representation) and then passed into the trained model for prediction.

    Display of Prediction: Based on the model's prediction (suicidal or non-suicidal), a reason is selected randomly from a list of reasons and displayed to the user on the screen.

To run the Streamlit app:
Install Streamlit:
pip install streamlit
Run the app:
streamlit run app.py
This will launch the app in your browser, where you can enter text, receive predictions, and view the reasons for those predictions.

2. Flask Deployment (server.py)
   Flask is a lightweight Python web framework that allows you to create full-fledged web applications. In this case, I used Flask to build a web server that serves the model’s prediction functionality through a traditional website.

   Model and Data Loading: Like in the Streamlit approach, the model, vocabulary, and reasons for prediction are loaded using pickle and open() functions.

   User Input: The HTML frontend (index.html) provides a text area where users can input their text. Upon clicking the "Predict" button, the text is sent to the Flask backend via an HTTP POST request.

  Text Preprocessing and Prediction: The backend processes the input text (similar to Streamlit), vectorizes it, and feeds it into the model for prediction. Based on the prediction result, a corresponding reason is chosen randomly from the reasons list (suicidal or non-suicidal).

  Display of Prediction: The result, along with the reason, is returned to the frontend in JSON format. JavaScript on the frontend dynamically updates the webpage to show the prediction result.

To run the Flask app:

Install Flask:
pip install flask
Run the server:
python server.py
After running the Flask app, you can access the model’s interface in your browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

Comparison
Streamlit:
  Streamlit is an excellent choice for quick and simple model deployment.
  It automatically creates a UI and handles the backend, making it ideal for prototyping and testing.
  It doesn't require complex setup or frontend code, but it is more suited for personal or small-scale applications.
Flask:
  Flask provides more flexibility and is suitable for building scalable and customizable web applications.
  With Flask, you can easily integrate the model into a more complex web application, use custom frontend HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and control the user interface and experience in a more detailed manner.
  It’s better for production-level deployment where you want more control over the application structure and deployment process.
Both deployment methods serve as different approaches to deploy a machine learning model, each with its own strengths. You can choose either method based on your project needs and goals.
